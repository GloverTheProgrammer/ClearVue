## Empowering Vision

Globally, an estimated 40 to 45 million people are blind, and 135 million have low vision. At ClearVue, we harness the power of the GPT-4 AI model and advanced sensory technology to help these individuals regain the ability to live their everyday lives. Our mission is to enable the visually impaired to 'see' their surroundings through auditory feedback, transforming their interaction with the world.

## Features
